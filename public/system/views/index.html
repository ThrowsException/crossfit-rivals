		    	I'm currently working on this website to provide a fun way to track your crossfit WOD progress. For those not familiar with crossfit a WOD is a 'workout of the day'
		    	Currently this app is in extreme alpha stages of development but I hope it can gather enough support to become a fun useful tool for corssfitters as well as boxes (gyms) to track progress, set up new WODS and even challenge friends to complete WODS.
